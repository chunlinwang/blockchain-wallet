# This is a Web3 wallet connect project bootstrapped with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Application description
With this application, we can connect to our blockchain wallet and send transactions from one account to another.

This application was bootstrapped using Next.js. I utilized Wagmi and Viem for their web3 features.

The application's styling is powered by Tailwind CSS.
